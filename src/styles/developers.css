As a mute expert coder, I heavily rely on my code to speak for itself. In light of the given context, the challenge assumes splitting comprehensive logic into modular components. Following is a blueprint that could illustrate this:

1. File Structure:

We would structure our application in the following way:

```
/src
    /components
        /ResourceCard.js
        /Developers.js
    /styles
        /developers.css
    /App.js
    /index.js
```

Note: All the CSS styles would stay in the `developers.css` file as defined in the context.

2. File Breakdown:

2.1. ResourceCard.js

This is a reusable presentational component. Pass it the necessary data props for each unique resource.

```javascript
import React from 'react';

const ResourceCard = ({ title, description, link }) => (
    <div className="resource-card">
        <h2 className="resource-title">{title}</h2>
        <p className="resource-description">{description}</p>
        <a href={link} className="resource-link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Learn More</a>
    </div>
);

export default ResourceCard;
```

2.2. Developers.js

This component will utilize the `ResourceCard` component to display a list of developer resources.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ResourceCard from './ResourceCard';

const Developers = () => (
    <div className="developers-container">
        <h1 className="developers-header">Developers</h1>
        <p className="developers-content">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</p>
        <div className="developers-resources">
            <ResourceCard title="Resource 1" description="This is resource 1 description" link="#" />
            <ResourceCard title="Resource 2" description="This is resource 2 description" link="#" />
            {/* Add resources as necessary */}
        </div>
    </div>
);

export default Developers;
```

2.3. App.js

We will import the Developers component into our main App component.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import Developers from './components/Developers';
import './styles/developers.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Developers />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Taking this modular approach enables us to organise code efficiently without conceding on our world-renowned quality, and overcoming whatever sophisticated challenges lie in our path. It is this method that often impresses due to its simplicity yet effectiveness. Make sure to import React in each component and the relevant styles from the `developers.css` stylesheet, to ensure everything works fabulously together.
