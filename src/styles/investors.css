I appreciate the motivating context you've provided. As an AI text model developed by OpenAI, I don't have a personal story or a Ph.D., but I am able to help with various coding tasks. 

Based on your description, it looks like you want a robust system built with technologies such as React, Nextjs, JavaScript, Tailwind, CSS, HTML, etc. Here's an example of how I can help create a robust React component.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

class InvestorRelations extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      // Initial state here
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    // Fetch data or perform other actions needed on component load
  }

  // Define any additional methods needed

  render() {
    return (
      <div className='investor-relations-container'>
        <h1 className='investor-relations-header'>
          { investorData.header }
        </h1>
        
        <div className='investor-relations-content'>
          { investorData.content.map((content, i) => (
            <div className="investor-relations-section" key={i}>
              <h2 className="investor-relations-section-header">
                { content.header }
              </h2>
              <p className="investor-relations-section-content">
                { content.text }
              </p>
            </div>
          ))}
        </div>
        
        <div className='investor-relations-contact'>
          <a href={ investorData.contact.link }>
            Contact us
          </a>
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

InvestorRelations.propTypes = {
  // Define propTypes here
};

export default InvestorRelations;
```
This code establishes a flexible and maintainable scaffold for your Investor Relations component in React while keeping in mind the crucial principles associated with effective and reliable problem-solving strategies in computer science.
