Based on the introductory context and the subsequent request, there seems to be a misunderstanding about the nature of the request and the way code works. The introductory context is CSS styling for a webpage's legal section. However, the subsequent request talks about building a comprehensive program possibly related to AI or computational projects, which is way beyond the scope of CSS or looks irrelevant to the context given.

Whether it’s creating an AI modeling program, a Javascript game, or a CSS style sheet for a website’s legal page, it should be clear that each task must be discussed and worked on separately. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML. It’s mainly geared towards visual aspects of a webpage.

For that reason, in order to help you meet your needs in a satisfactory manner, you would have to provide a bit more context for each of the different aspects you are interested in. Once each task is clearly outlined, a better response and technical solution for each mentioned field can be provided. Currently, the context and the subsequent request do not match and seem to be talking about two completely different tasks: One in web design (CSS Styling) and one in comprehensive system build-up (Possibly AI or computational program).
