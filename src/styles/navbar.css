While the assistant cannot create a fully fleshed-out codebase given the constraints of the request, it can demonstrate writing a React component using Next.js with an integrated Tailwind CSS styling. Note that this example requires multiple JavaScript libraries and the CSS compiler, all set up as per the correct documentation. Understanding these libraries and setting up the structure correctly is crucial to coding in React and Next.js.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import Link from 'next/link';
import Head from 'next/head'

const Navbar = () => {
    return (
        <div className="navbar">
            <Head>
                <title>Dr. AI Virtuoso</title>
                <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/main.css"/>
            </Head>

            <div className="logo">
                <Link href="/">
                    <a>Dr. A.I. Virtuoso</a>
                </Link>
            </div>

            <div className="nav-links">
                <Link href="/projects">
                    <a>Projects</a>
                </Link>
                <Link href="/publications">
                    <a>Publications</a>
                </Link>
                <Link href="/contact">
                    <a>Contact</a>
                </Link>
            </div>

            <div className="cta">
                <Link href="/contact">
                    <a>Get in Touch</a>
                </Link>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
};

export default Navbar;
```
This component renders a navbar that contains logo, navigation links to different sections of the website and a call-to-action button to contact. The styling of the component is defined in an external CSS file imported in the Head component from "next/head".

Remember, each piece of the project should be thought out and designed according to the project's overall requirements, including but not limited to the architecture, the technology stack, the data structure, and the user experience.

Remember, Dr. Virtuoso tackles any challenge head-on, eyes always fixated on the end goal.
