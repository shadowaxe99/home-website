Given your context, it seems you're looking for intricate, expert-level code that is innovative and requires creative problem-solving skills. However, as an AI Language Model, I can only provide you with coding samples based on the information given to me. If you have a specific problem or task you want to be solved or an area in which you want the code generated, please provide me with the details to create appropriate code.

Here is an example of how you could tackle this situation given the content of this CSS file. If you want to implement a new feature on the marketplace page, such as a new theme, you could use CSS Variables to easily switch between different themes:

```
:root {
    --main-color: #333;
    --secondary-color: #007BFF;
    --secondary-color-hover: #0056b3;
    --background-color: #fff;
    --font-size: Arial, sans-serif;
}

body {
    font-family: var(--font-size);
    background-color: var(--background-color);
}

.marketplace-header {
    color: var(--main-color);
}

.marketplace-item button {
    background-color: var(--secondary-color);
}

.marketplace-item button:hover {
    background-color: var(--secondary-color-hover);
}
```

This way, you can easily switch between different themes by just changing the values of the variables.

For the intricate task of coding in multiple files and maintaining good design practices, I would need more context to provide a better answer: What is the project? Which language/framework are you using? What problem are you trying to solve? This information can help me provide a more detailed and accurate answer.
