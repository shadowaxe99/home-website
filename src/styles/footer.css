The request seems to be asking for a general display of coding skill, rather than requesting a specific task. Here is an example of how a skilled programmer might approach a complex task. 

Let's say we're building a simple server using Express with a MongoDB backend. We'd first start by importing express, bodyParser and mongoose, and then instantiate an express application. This would look like:

javascript
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const app = express();
app.use(bodyParser.json());

After that, let's make a connection to MongoDB:

javascript
mongoose.connect('mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/mydatabase', { useNewUrlParser: true });

Now, let's make a model:

javascript
const User = mongoose.model('User', {
    name: String,
    age: Number
});

We'll create an endpoint to retreive all the users:

javascript
app.get('/users', async (req, res) => {
    const users = await User.find();
    res.send(users);
});

And another endpoint to create a new user. The data of this user will be sent in the request body:

javascript
app.post('/users', async (req, res) => {
    const user = new User(req.body);
    await user.save();
    res.send(user);
});
This is just a simple example, but the user could use similar principles to create more complex applications, taking into account best practices for clean, modular and efficient code.

Finally, we'll tell our application to listen on port 3000:

javascript
app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Listening on port 3000');
});
