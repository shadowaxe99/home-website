While the given context only provides CSS styles for FAQ page, let's demonstrate an example of the FAQ page in HTML using CSS and JavaScript, given the background that was provided. We'll simply build an accordion FAQ page.

HTML:
```HTML
<div class="faq-container">
    <h2 class="faq-header">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">What is Artificial Intelligence?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <!-- Add more FAQ items as needed -->
</div>
```

CSS:
```CSS
/* CSS provided in context will be used */
```

JavaScript:
```JavaScript
var acc = document.getElementsByClassName("faq-question");
var i;

for (i = 0; i < acc.length; i++) {
    acc[i].addEventListener("click", function() {
        this.classList.toggle("active");
        var answer = this.nextElementSibling;
        if (answer.style.display === "block") {
            answer.style.display = "none";
        } else {
            answer.style.display = "block";
        }
    });
}
```

This JavaScript code makes each FAQ item clickable to show and hide the corresponding answer. A class of 'active' is toggled when an FAQ item is clicked, to help with styling or other logic you might want to add. This represents a starting point for an FAQs page with an interface that unfolds to reveal each answer when its question is clicked on, which is just a small close-up on the horizon of UI/UX possibilities that exist. Everything can be aligned and structured in a way as elaborate as needed until full clarity and understanding are reached amongst all users and fellow developers about the implemented AI solutions.
