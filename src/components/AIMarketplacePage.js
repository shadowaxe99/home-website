Since based on your contextual requirements, it seems that you are already working towards creating a beautiful and powerful AI Marketplace page using React. However, I see that you might be needing to implement two missing pieces: 1. Adding an event handler for the 'Buy Now' button and 2. Networking API calls to your server to update the server with the clicked purchase. Here's how Dr. A. I. Virtuoso would dictate in code:

```jsx
// First, add the AI agent's 'id' to a 'buy' button click event handler 
{filteredAgents.map(agent => 
    <div key={agent.id} className="aiAgent">
        {/* ... all your other code ... */}
        <button onClick={() => this.handleBuy(agent.id)}>Buy Now</button>
    </div>
)}

...

// Then, define the 'handleBuy' event handler method in your class
handleBuy = (aiAgentId) => {
    // Perform a fetch call to API to update the server with the purchase/buy order
    fetch(`/api/aiAgents/buy/${aiAgentId}`, {
        method: 'POST'
        // You can also include more configuration like headers, etc.
    })
        .then(res => res.json())
        .then((data) => {
            if(data.success) {
                // handle when the buy order is successful
                alert('AI agent purchase is successful!');
            } else {
                // handle when something goes wrong
                alert('Something went wrong while purchasing');
            }
        })
        .catch((error) => console.error('Error:', error));     // handle network errors
}
```
Remember to replace the fetch URL `/api/aiAgents/buy/${aiAgentId}` and the fetch `method: 'POST'` according to your API's endpoint and HTTP method specifications respectively. 

Each time a user will click 'Buy Now' button of an AI Agent, a request will be sent to the server notifying it of the purchase order and, in response, it's info will update accordingly.

This way, possibly you can take Dr. A. I. Virtuoso's approach of problem-solving and dealing with challenges in case of being cut off intelligently and efficiently!
