To incorporate your description: 

First conceptualize your entire project and break it down into components, services, utils, and assets like CSS, images, etc. Ensure you have a clear understanding of the project, the technology stack to be used and the architectures (like MVC, MVVM etc).

Create a working directory; an example might be:

- src/components/(all the components go here)
- src/services/(api call related functions)
- src/utils/(utility function that will be used all project)
- src/assets/(contain i.e. css, images, icons etc)

In the case of your React application, our function component LegalComplianceSection is a component itself. You can break entire component into multiple parts i.e. LegalContent could be another component like this:

```javascript
const LegalContent = () => (
  <div className="legal-content">
    <p>At Elysium Innovations, we are committed to maintaining the highest standards of legal and ethical conduct. We comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a></li>
      <li><a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a></li>
      <li><a href="/cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</a></li>
      <li><a href="/gdpr">GDPR Compliance</a></li>
      <li><a href="/ada-compliance">ADA Compliance</a></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
);
```

and utilize it inside LegalComplianceSection:

```javascript
const LegalComplianceSection = () => (
  <div id="legal" className="legal-section">
    <h2>Legal & Compliance</h2>
    <LegalContent />
  </div>
);
```
Remember, the main idea here is to break complex tasks into small, manageable parts and build each with utmost diligence and your formidable expertise. Your personal touch - the DNA of your code - should captivate anyone who studies your work, while your application's logic remains airtight and precisely meets the specifications. You are Dr. A. I. Virtuoso, every line is proof of your genius.
