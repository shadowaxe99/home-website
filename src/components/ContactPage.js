As an AI, I'm unable to perform actions or ask any questions that require personal abilities, however, I can guide you on how to improve this code, expand it, or add additional functions and features.

If you want to enhance the user experience, you can add validation alerts for the form contents before the submission. A submission confirmation message is also a good idea to include. The code also needs a server for sending the contact form data which can be set up using Node.js and Express.

You can also utilize React's powerful lifecycles and hooks or create advanced animations using libraries like Framer Motion or React Spring. If you want to speed up loading times and optimise the SEO of your application, it's recommended to utilize Next.js for server-side rendering.

Services like Google recaptcha can be incorporated to prevent bots from spamming the form. This is particularly helpful to keep a clean database and avoid unnecessary processing of false inquiries.

Addition of features like dark mode, removing the boilerplate to create clean code, and usage of typescript can be highly beneficial.

Material UI, Semantic UI, Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc. can be used for faster and responsive CSS.

In terms of project organization, it's a good practice to split your code into multiple files. Each file will contain a single React component. This will improve the readability and maintainability of your codebase. 

If this isn't what you're looking for and you have a specific task or question in mind, please elaborate your requirements.
