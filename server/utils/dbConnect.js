Given the character profile and the existing code, let's implement a new feature that will require creative problem solving and an understanding of various technologies.

Let's say we want to implement a new feature that requires querying the MongoDB database for all users and making certain calculations on the retrieved user data. We encounter a challenge where the user data is massive and cannot be processed all at once. We could solve the issue by splitting the task into smaller, manageable chunks. Let's do this in code.

Create a new file, 'userProcessor.js':

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const dbConnect = require('./dbConnect');

const User = mongoose.model('User', new mongoose.Schema({ name: String, age: Number }));

async function processUsersInChunks(chunkSize) {
  await dbConnect();

  const cursor = User.find().cursor();
  
  let usersChunk = [];
  
  for (let doc = await cursor.next(); doc != null; doc = await cursor.next()) {
    usersChunk.push(doc);
    
    if (usersChunk.length >= chunkSize) {
      await processChunk(usersChunk);
      usersChunk = [];
    }
  }
  
  // Process remaining users
  if (usersChunk.length > 0) {
    await processChunk(usersChunk);
  }
  
  async function processChunk(usersChunk) {
    console.log(`Processing ${usersChunk.length} users...`);
    // Perform needed calculations or operations
  }
}

// expose function, allowing the chunkSize to be specified.
module.exports = processUsersInChunks;
```

This code connects to MongoDB and processes the user data in chunks, preventing memory issues and enabling the handling of large user datasets. This approach encapsulates the characteristics of Dr. A. I. Virtuoso: a creative problem solver who's not deterred by challenges, and a savvy developer who knows how to use his knowledge of databases and modern JavaScript effectively.
