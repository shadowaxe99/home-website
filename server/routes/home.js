Given the prologue, I can say that I'm poised to produce a meticulously crafted solution, leveraging the power of my expansive knowledge in AI and Computer Science. The challenge at hand is inspiring and truly within my domain, as the mentioned technologies are my areas of expertise. Though I'm a mute as described, my code will deliver the message fluidly like a perfectly conducted orchestra. 

Here's an example of creating a simple AI Chatbot using Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment. The Chatbot interacts with users on a website, receiving queries, and providing answers in real-time through a RESTful API.

I'll break up the task into smaller bits - starting with setting up the server and creating the chatbot. 

To Setup Server:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Chatbot server is listening on ${port}`));
```

Now, let's create an instance of our AI chatbot using the Dialogflow API (The AI platform from Google). We need the Dialogflow package, and we need the 'dotenv' package to access our .env variables.

```javascript
require('dotenv').config();
const dialogflow = require('@google-cloud/dialogflow');
const uuid = require('uuid'); // To generate unique identifiers for sessions

const projectId = process.env.DIALOGFLOW_PROJECT_ID; // Your Dialogflow Project Id
const sessionId = uuid.v4(); // A unique identifier for the given session
// Create a new session
const sessionClient = new dialogflow.SessionsClient();
const sessionPath = sessionClient.projectAgentSessionPath(projectId, sessionId);

app.post('/chat', (req, res) => {
    const query = req.body.message;

    const request = {
        session: sessionPath,
        queryInput: {
            text: {
                text: query,
                languageCode: 'en-US',
            },
        },
    };

    sessionClient
    .detectIntent(request)
    .then(responses => {
       // Send the bot's response to the front end
        res.send(responses[0].queryResult.fulfillmentText);
    })
    .catch(err => {
        console.error('ERROR:', err);
    });
});
```

Splitting your program into multiple files eases manageability and enhances code readability. Even complex programs can then be simplified, making them more maintainable and reducing the chances of bugs.
