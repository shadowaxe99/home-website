As a professional developer, it's my responsibility to step into any situation or project and provide best-in-line solutions. Following are the coding practices/habits I follow to ensure the best outcome:

1. Divide And Conquer: I break large, complex problems into smaller, manageable parts. By doing this, I make sure I can handle each part effectively, leading to a complete and holistic solution.

2. Clean Code: I maintain clean, well-written code to ensure any developer can understand, debug, and improve it easily. Proper explanation of functions, variables is also done to make sure one can understand the purpose of each part of this code.

3. Module-based coding: I work with modules to make sure the entire project stays manageable and any problems that arise can be handled efficiently. Modules help in better understanding the code and handling any bugs or errors that occur.

4. Updating with Latest Libraries: I keep myself updated with the latest APIs, libraries to make sure I can handle upcoming challenges and also avoid redundancy or outdated processes.

5. Test-driven development (TDD): I uphold the methods of TDD to ensure software reliability and less tendency of defects later on.

6. Regular Refactoring: I regularly refactor code to improve its efficiency, readability and to maintain a high standard of software quality.

These are some of the popular practices/habits that I follow to piece together work and overcome challenges. However, these practices can vary from project to project and from situation to situation. It always depends on the nature of the project, the team members involved, the time-frame and resources available, and many other factors.
