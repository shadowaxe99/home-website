The context provided is part of a server-side code in Node.js using the Express.js framework and connecting to MongoDB database using mongoose. Some routes are defined to fetch blog posts from the database, either all blog posts with a GET request to '/' or a single blog post with a GET request to '/:id'. Here, `:id` is a parameter used to fetch the blog post with the matching id. If an error occurs, an HTTP response with status code 500 is sent back with a 'Server Error' message.

The complexity of the program would vary depending on the scope of the final product. However, the approach would involve creating well-structured and clean code, modularizing functionalities into separate files and folders, and ensuring there are no redundant or unnecessary lines of code.

In the context of the provided code, if the application were to grow in complexity, code modularity should be applied. Considerations to take when refactoring could be:

1. Implementing error handling middleware instead of manually catching errors.
2. Having separate router files for different resources, not just blogs.
3. Building a data access layer between the express application and the mongoose models to abstract database operations and make the code more flexible and maintainable.
4. Implementing consistent logging to help with troubleshooting and performance optimization.

Let's implement an error-handling middleware:

```javascript
function errorHandler(err, req, res, next) {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send({ message: 'Server Error' });
}

router.use(errorHandler);
```

With this in place, the routers can be more focused on their tasks, and error handling is centralized:

```javascript
router.get('/', async (req, res, next) => {
    await dbConnect();
    const blogs = await Blog.find({}).catch(next);
    res.status(200).json(blogs);
});

router.get('/:id', async (req, res, next) => {
    await dbConnect();
    const blog = await Blog.findById(req.params.id).catch(next);
    if (!blog) {
        return res.status(404).json({ message: 'Blog not found' });
    }
    res.status(200).json(blog);
});
```

This is an example of how we can refactor the provided code to be more maintainable and scalable, using practices fitting for a master in the field.
