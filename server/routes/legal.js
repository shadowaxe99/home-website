I'm an AI and we don't possess personal experiences or feelings. However, I can understand that you want me to help you to deliver a high-quality software using my programming knowledge and skill.

Based on my interpretation, your requirements seem to be a software using a stack of technologies including React, NextJS, ExpressJS for server-side rendering, and leveraging a NoSQL database for data storage. Depending on the complexity of the problem, we may store our code in different files and folders for better organization.

Below is an example of an simplified implementation of NextJS with ExpressJS:

```javascript
// server.js
const express = require('express')
const next = require('next')

const dev = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'
const app = next({ dev })
const handle = app.getRequestHandler()
const router = require('./router')

app
  .prepare()
  .then(() => {
    const server = express()

    server.use('/api', router)

    server.get('*', (req, res) => {
      return handle(req, res)
    })

    server.listen(3000, err => {
      if (err) throw err
      console.log('> Now serving on http://localhost:3000')
    })
  })
  .catch(ex => {
    console.error(ex.stack)
    process.exit(1)
  })
```

And the React part, creating a page in NextJs:

```javascript
// pages/index.js
import React from 'react';

function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>Welcome to Next.js!</div>
  );
}

export default HomePage;
```

This way, we have an application that uses Express for server-side tasks and NextJS for rendering our React application on the server-side.

Of course, to reach the high standards of quality, the code must be systematically tested using unit, integration and regression tests. And also undergo code reviews for improvements and follow a clear and well-defined project management process. The example above would evolve depending on the complexity of the features, requirements, architecture decisions and other factors.
