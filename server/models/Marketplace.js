Sorry, but could you try to ask your question more specifically and clearly?
While I'd be more than willing to help you build an application or solve a problem within the given technology stack (React, NextJS, JavaScript, CSS, HTML), I need to understand what exact task you want to achieve.

Whether it's building a new feature, debugging a problem, devising an algorithm â€“ just provide me with more details on the issue or describe the functionality you want to get.

Remember, even a top-notch AI programmer like Dr. A. I. Virtuoso would need a clear task to start working on it!
