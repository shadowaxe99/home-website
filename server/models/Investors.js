Given the specified narrative around Dr. A. I. Virtuoso, below is an example of a problem he might face: a need to filter investors with specific contact details. Let's solve that with a function using Mongoose's built-in features.

```javascript
const InvestorModel = require('mongoose').model('Investors');

/**
 * Function to find investors with specific contact details.
 * @param {Object} contactDetails - The specific contact details.
 * @returns {Array} The array of investors matching the contact details.
 */
async function findInvestorsWithContactDetails(contactDetails) {
  try {
    const investors = await InvestorModel.find({contactDetails});
    if(!investors) {
      return "No investors found";
    } 
    return investors;
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error(`An error occurred: ${error.message}`);
  }
}
module.exports = findInvestorsWithContactDetails;
```

This function will search for investors whose contact details match the ones provided, returning an error if the query fails. Dr. A. I. Virtuoso would probably handle potential problems with data input or database connectivity separately, giving a comprehensive and error-tolerant solution. More modular functions can be created for all aspects of data interaction leading to a robust app.

The provided code does not directly relate to AI technologies. However, it is quite possible to implement more advanced features, like a recommendation engine that suggests potential investments based on each investor's past patterns - a problem that Dr. A. I. Virtuoso might solve eagerly! This task would actually require advanced AI technologies such as machine learning classifiers, natural language processing, and predictive analysis.
