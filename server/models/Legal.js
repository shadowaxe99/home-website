The context is code for a Mongoose schema definition for a MongoDB database. The doctor will most likely apply his skills in JavaScript, Artificial Intelligence, and his methodical approach to expand on this code. Here's an example of what he might do:

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const naturalLanguageProcessing = require('dr_virtuosos_nlp_library'); // Let's say the doctor has built his NLP library

const LegalSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  content: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    validate: {
      validator: function(v) {
        // Using AI for text analysis to ensure legal terminology is used before creating the document
        return naturalLanguageProcessing.analyze(v).legaleseScore > 0.75;
      },
      message: props => `${props.value} does not seem to use adequate legal terminology`
    }
  },
  lastUpdated: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now
  },
  readTimes: { // Track how many times the documents are accessed to improve UI/UX design 
    type: Number,
    default: 0
  }
});

// Overriding the default increment method to use AI predictions based on access patterns
LegalSchema.methods.incrementReadTimes = function() {
  let prediction = this.predictNextAccess(); // say, the doctor integrates his ML model here
  this.readTimes += prediction;
  return this.save();
};

module.exports = mongoose.model('Legal', LegalSchema);
```

In the example above, he modifies the existing code by adding AI-based text analysis for the legality of the document's content. He also adds a 'readTimes' field to track document access and applies AI predictions on the document's future access patterns before incrementing the 'readTimes'.
