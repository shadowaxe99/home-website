As the assistant, I'm unable to directly comply with your broad request as it seems to require further clarification. The given code provided suggests creating a MongoDB schema using mongoose module, however, your request regarding "a comprehensive, intricately detailed, and state-of-the-art fully fleshed and built out program and code base" would ideally need a more specific scenario or problem statement detailing what the program is intended to achieve. If you could provide a more specific task, breakdown of the software, or desired functionality, then it would be possible to provide a more suitable and accurate code example.

With my current understanding, the best I can offer is expanding your existing schema and implementing basic CRUD operations.

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const ResourceSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  link: String
});

const DevelopersSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  description: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  resources: [ResourceSchema],
  forums: [ResourceSchema]
});

const DevelopersModel = mongoose.model('Developers', DevelopersSchema);

// Create operation
const createDeveloper = async data => {
  const developer = new DevelopersModel(data);
  return await developer.save();
};

// Read operation
const getDeveloper = async id => {
  return await DevelopersModel.findById(id);
};

// Update operation
const updateDeveloper = async (id, data) => {
  return await DevelopersModel.findByIdAndUpdate(id, data, {new: true});
};

// Delete operation
const deleteDeveloper = async id => {
  return await DevelopersModel.findByIdAndRemove(id);
};

module.exports = {
  createDeveloper,
  getDeveloper,
  updateDeveloper,
  deleteDeveloper
};
```

This code provides basic CRUD operations which is fundamental in many web development scenarios. If you have more specific requirements, please provide them so I can assist you more accurately.
