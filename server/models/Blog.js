Sure, let's start with setting up the server for our application. I'll be using Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose. Please note that since this is a collaborative setup, you'll need to ensure that MongoDB is installed and running on your machine. Let's also install Mongoose and Express. Write this in your terminal:

```sh
npm install express mongoose
```

```jsx
// server.js
const express = require('express');
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const app = express();

// MongoDB Connection
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/my_database', { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });

// Middleware to parse req.body
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use(express.json());

// Include the Blog Model
const Blog = require('./models/Blog');

// Get all Blogs
app.get('/blogs', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const blogs = await Blog.find();
    res.json(blogs);
  } catch (err) {
    res.json({ message: err });
  }
});

// Create a Blog
app.post('/blogs', async (req, res) => {
  const blog = new Blog({
    title: req.body.title,
    content: req.body.content,
    category: req.body.category,
  });

  try {
    const savedBlog = await blog.save();
    res.json(savedBlog);
  } catch (err) {
    res.json({ message: err });
  }
});

// Set the port to listen Requests
app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server is running on port 3000. Dr. A. I. Virtuoso is on the case.'));
```

The server is designed in such a way that it handles both GET request at URI '/blogs' to fetch all blogs and a POST request at the same URI to create a new blog. The creation and fetching of blogs are done via the Blog model that you provided.

This is a simple setup for developing an application with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. This is usually how I initiate my projects when divided into multiple parts. The key to managing complexity is to keep things simple and modular. Every part of an application should do one thing and do it well.

As a CTO, developer, and professor, it's equally important to realize that while we focus on comprehensive solutions, we should not lose sight of the user's needs. That's why we're using a simple and intuitive blogging platform as an example here. This project could be scaled up to feature user logins, categories, tags, comments, and much more. Each of these could be a separate module that can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.

Remember, the real power of programming is not about knowing the fanciest algorithms, but how effectively you solve problems and add value to the people using your application. Look at every challenge as an opportunity to learn, innovate, and stand out from the crowd.

Code is poetry, lets compose a symphony.
