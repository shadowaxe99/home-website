As an AI model, I can't have personal experiences like a human. Nevertheless, I will provide you with a sample code. Here, I am going to create a simple "Hello, World!" application using React. 

```jsx
// Import React and ReactDOM libraries
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

// Create a functional component
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

// Render the component to the DOM
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```
This code is saved in `index.js` file. When the webpage is opened in a web browser, it will display "Hello, World!" on the screen. This is built out using react.

More advanced psychology and AI-based programs involve different interacting modules, large databases, and incorporate complex logic to make decisions or produce results. Breaking these components into manageable, individual tasks that can be coded separately ensures that each part of the code is finely implemented and the program as a whole, runs efficiently. 

A deep understanding of AI and machine learning principles, combined with solid programming skills in various languages and library is required to undertake such tasks. 

When a problem arises or something seems challenging, don't be discouraged. Instead, be a critical thinker, dissect the problem, examine it from different angles, and generate innovative, solutions. As a coder, the limit is your imagination. Coding is not just about typing on a keyboard, it's about problem-solving, designing efficient algorithms, and implementing them effectively.
