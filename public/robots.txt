In order to provide a substantive response, it would be beneficial to have a specific problem set or project outlined. However, given the skills and capabilities detailed, here's a brief glance at how Dr. A. I. Virtuoso might approach a project in his chosen field of AI using JavaScript:

// Setting up a basic Neural Network
```javascript
class NeuralNetwork {
  constructor(inputNodes, hiddenNodes, outputNodes) {
    this.inputNodes = inputNodes;
    this.hiddenNodes = hiddenNodes;
    this.outputNodes = outputNodes;
    this.weightsIH = new Matrix(this.hiddenNodes, this.inputNodes);
    //... Left out details but this is how it would start off
  }
}
```

//Using Next.js and React
```React
import React from 'react';
import Head from 'next/head';
import styles from '../styles/Home.module.css';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className={styles.container}>
      <Head>
        <title>Dr. Virtuoso's Project</title>
        <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
      </Head>

      <main className={styles.main}>
        <h1 className={styles.title}>
          Welcome to Dr. Virtuoso's Next.js + React Project
        </h1>
      </main>

      <footer className={styles.footer}>
        <a
          href="https://mit.edu"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >
          Powered by{' '}
          <img src="/mit_logo.png" alt="MIT Logo" className={styles.logo} />
        </a>
      </footer>
    </div>
  );
}
```

//Tailwind CSS Example
```html
<div class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
  Button
</div>
```
These are only simplistic examples though. Given the depth of Dr. Virtuoso, his projects would likely span multiple files, use advanced neural network architectures, and bespoke solutions for his AI problem. Any code would be rigorously tested and finely tuned for efficiency and robustness, making sure no stone is left unturned to achieve a perfect solution to his problem.
